# Day 18 of Advent of Code 2023
# Lavaduct Lagoon

# We have successfully brought the machine parts factory into operation following the return of the lavafall,
# becoming one of the first functional factories. However, to address the substantial backlog of parts requests,
# we require an extensive supply of lava. The Elves have initiated the creation of a large lagoon nearby for this
# purpose, but doubts arise about its adequacy. Tasked with examining the dig plan, we confirm the Elves' concerns as
# the planned lagoon proves much too small. Upon investigation, it becomes evident that a mistake occurred during the
# dig plan's production â€“ a mix-up between color and instruction parameters. With no time to fix the bug,
# the Elves request our assistance in extracting the correct instructions from the hexadecimal codes.
