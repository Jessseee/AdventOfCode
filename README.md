# AdventOfCode2020

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. I chose to tackle the challenge using Python 3. If you also want to participate or want more information on the challenge check out the website [https://adventofcode.com/about](https://adventofcode.com/about).
