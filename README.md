<h1>AdventOfCode</h1>
<p>
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets that can be solved in any programming language you like. I chose to tackle the challenges using <b>Python</b>. Whenever I have been unable to solve a puzzle on my own and used hints from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/">sub-Reddit</a> or large code snippits from sites like StackOverflow, I will credit this. If I copied your code but somehow forgot to credit, please message me and I will correct it. 

If you also want to participate or want more information on the challenges check out <a href="https://adventofcode.com/about">the website</a>. Huge thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ericwastl">Eric</a> for creating these awesome puzzles and bringing the christmas joy of programming to us all. <i>Happy coding!</i>
